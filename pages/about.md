Hello, this is Sihan. Nice to meet you here. I'm a graduate student in MUSA program at the University of Pennsylvania. I earned my bachelor's degree majoring in Cartography & GIS and Computer Science at UW-Madison. I love the combination of technology and creativity, so I call myself an art programmer. It has been a fantastic journey since I made my first cartography "masterpiece" in high school. Six years later, I became a professional cartographer. Working at Robinson's Map Library, Wisconsin State Cartographer's Office, and Sea Grant Institute were the most remarkable experiences of my college life.
